# String Calculator Kata

A TDD kata which adds new requirements incrementally to simulate a real business situation. 

I completed the steps found [here](https://kata-log.rocks/string-calculator-kata) one after another, with each step adding new functionality.

Started by testing the simplest case first and building complexity by adding new tests when each was satisfied. 

### How to Run

Run tests by opening SpecRunner.html.
